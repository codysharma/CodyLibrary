-Is there a way to turn all my different catalog get requests into one?  
-When trying to do class based "views", I kept getting an error that template does not exist.  
-Can't make delete view work. Having the same pk argument issue, but still not resolved after debugging.  

-Turn all my <ul> displays into individual divs, like components  
-Nav bar still not centering
  
-Make the catalog_nav sticky?
